# Runbook — audit and fix grid names, and check them in Milliman Mind

Companion to [RUN_IN_MIND.md](RUN_IN_MIND.md), which covers getting a workbook
to convert and run. This one covers the next question: **does every grid have a
name a human recognises, once it is in Mind?**

It reproduces, step by step, the audit that produced Mind Ready **1.6.7**.

> Since **1.7.0** there is also a hands-on alternative: the **Grid Namer**
> screen (sidebar). It shows the whole workbook sheet by sheet with the
> detected grids outlined; drag over an area, type the name you want, tick
> flags, Submit — everything you did not touch is named by the conventions
> this runbook audits. Use this runbook when you want the *automatic* names
> checked; use the Grid Namer when you already know what a block is called.

Why it matters: Mind lists every grid by name in the `work ▾` template selector.
A grid with no `#Title` above it is listed as **`Untitled(60,8)`** — the row and
column of its first cell. A grid the app could only call `Cashflows C4` is no
better. Neither stops the model converting or running; both make it unreadable.

## Before you start

| Need | Check |
|---|---|
| App running, 1.6.7 or later | <http://localhost:8600/api/health> → `"version":"1.6.7"` |
| Excel installed | the same endpoint → `"excel":true` (grid titles are written through Excel) |
| Assistant reachable (optional) | the same endpoint → `"assistant":true` (a `secret.key` is found nearby) |
| Workbook is `.xlsx` / `.xlsm` | Mind rejects `.xlsb`; *Save As* → Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook first |

Start the app with `run_mind_ready_web.bat` in `excel-upload-preparation`.

Everything below reads an **immutable copy**. Your source workbook is never
touched, and nothing is written to it at any point.

---

## Part A — Audit the names (read-only, no UI)

`scripts/audit_grid_names.py` is the whole audit in one command.

```bash
cd excel-upload-preparation
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "path\to\YourModel.xlsm"
```

It prints the five numbers that matter:

```json
{
  "grids": 156,
  "unnamed": 60,
  "weak": 76,
  "title_operations": 50,
  "blocked": 19
}
```

Read them like this:

- **`unnamed`** — grids with no `#Title` at all. **This is your `Untitled(r,c)`
  count in Mind.**
- **`weak`** — grids whose name carries no meaning: the `<Sheet> <Anchor>`
  fallback (`Cashflows C4`), or a scrap of a header row (`I`, `I I ...`).
  Judged by `prep.is_weak_name()`.
- **`title_operations`** — how many titles the prep plan can write on its own.
- **`blocked`** — grids it *cannot* title, each with the reason, printed below
  the totals. Read these: they are the ones needing a human decision.

Add `--output audit.json` for the full per-grid table (current name, what the
heuristics propose, and where that name came from).

### A2. Read the surrounding cells yourself

To judge a name you need to see what the grid actually holds:

```bash
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "YourModel.xlsm" --context context.txt
```

`context.txt` gets one block per unnamed/weak grid — the cells above it, the
cells to its left, and its first rows, with **formulas shown as
`formula => computed value`** so a column of `=INDEX(...)` is readable:

```
--- Cashflows!C27:E39  (13 rows x 3 cols)  current=None
 ABOVE:
   B25=#Cashflows B24 | B26==MAX($B$3:B25)+1 => 2 | C26=Demographic Assumptions
 DATA:
   Gender | =INDEX(CoverageDetails!A:CE, => ... | =IF(D27="זכר","M","F") => M
   Smoker | =INDEX(CoverageDetails!A:CE, => ... | =IF(D28="מעשן","S","NS") => NS
```

This is exactly what a person (or the assistant) reads to name a grid. Naming
from this file, before looking at any suggestion, is how you keep your own
judgement independent — do that if you intend to compare candidates.

### A3. Ask the assistant for names

```bash
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "YourModel.xlsm" --suggest --output audit.json
```

Each weak grid gains a `"suggested"` field. The assistant is asked in **batches
of 25** through the Milliman APIM gateway (`app/grid_naming.py`), so a whole
workbook costs a handful of calls. If no `secret.key` is found it says so on
stderr and the deterministic names stand — naming never hard-depends on the
network.

## Part B — Apply the names in the app

1. **Upload** your `.xlsm` on the Workbook screen (<http://localhost:8600>).
2. Go to **Prep**. The first panel is **“Name grids from their context.”**
3. Click **Suggest names**. The app sends only the grids whose deterministic
   name is meaningless, and shows a review table:

   | Grid | From the cells around it | Assistant |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Cashflows!C43:D47` `5x2` | *Cashflows C43* (sheet name + position) | Sum Assured And Inflation |

   Names in italics are the meaningless fallback. Accepted names are folded
   into the plan below — **nothing is written yet.**
4. Tick **“Give every untitled grid one '#Name' title…”** and review its
   operations cell by cell (**Show operations**). Read its **SKIPPED** list too
   — that is the `blocked` set from Part A.
5. Click **Apply**. Excel writes the titles to a fresh copy, the copy is
   verified to open, and a change log is written beside it.
6. **Download** the prepared file from the **Download** area in the left sidebar.

> The assistant only changes *which* name a title operation writes. It never
> decides *where* a title goes or whether the edit is safe — those stay
> deterministic, and every operation is still reviewed and approved by you.

### Confirm it improved

Re-run Part A against the file you just downloaded:

```bash
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "YourModel_v2.xlsm"
```

`unnamed` should drop sharply (60 → 39 on the Shlomo model) and `grids` should
stay roughly flat. **If the grid count jumps, stop** — see “When it goes wrong”.

---

## Part C — Verify in Milliman Mind

1. Upload the prepared file to a Mind project and convert it — steps 6–10 of
   [RUN_IN_MIND.md](RUN_IN_MIND.md).
2. After **Add template to Milliman Mind**, click the **`work ▾`** selector in
   the middle of the top bar. It lists every template and grid by name.
3. Scan the list for **`Untitled(row,col)`** entries and for names like
   `Cashflows C4`. Each one is a grid Part A predicted; the row/column in
   `Untitled(60,8)` maps to row 60, column 8 (= `H60`).

That comparison — Mind's own list against the audit — is what proves the audit
matches what Mind actually shows.

## When it goes wrong

**Grid count jumps after applying.** The workbook is being fragmented, not
tidied. Do not upload it; go back to the previous version.

This is what the 1.6.7 investigation found: Excel stores error *values* as text
starting with `#`, and they were being read as `#Title` markers. Five `#N/A`
cells inside a 411×84 policy table looked like titles “trapped” in the grid
(STR-001), so the default-on **“Insert an empty row before a '#Title' trapped
inside a grid”** action offered to insert rows straight through that table.
Applying it took the model from **156 grids to 258 in one pass, and 648 over
three**.

Fixed in 1.6.7 (`grids.looks_like_title()` ignores Excel error literals). To
check any workbook prepped by an **earlier** version, compare grid counts before
and after:

```bash
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "before.xlsm"   # note "grids"
python scripts/audit_grid_names.py "after.xlsm"    # should be close, not multiplied
```

A large increase means that version's prep sliced the workbook — re-prep the
original with 1.6.7.

**Do not loop the prep to chase zero.** Applying prep to its own output
repeatedly keeps inserting rows and slowly grows the workbook for ever fewer
new names. Run **one** pass, then handle what is left by hand.

## What the app cannot name, and why

The reasons printed under `blocked` are worth understanding — they are design
limits, not bugs:

- **“the cell above (D4) is not free and inserting a row would cut *X*”** — a
  title must sit directly above its grid. Here the row above holds the grid's
  own header row, and a whole-row insert would slice a neighbouring wide table.
  On the Shlomo model this is most of the `Assumptions` lookup tables
  (Mortality, Lapses, Discount Curves, Taarif …): their **header row and their
  data are read as two separate grids**, because the label column beside the
  data is empty so the block is not rectangular. Merging header and data into
  one block is a modelling decision for a human — the app will not restructure
  a table to win a name.
- **“contains a trapped '#Title' (STR-001) — separate the grids first”** — a
  `#Title` sits inside the grid. Deal with that deliberately; do not chain the
  separation action blindly (see above).
