"""Builds the reviewable Excel outputs.

Two products (CHANGELOG 1.3.0):

* **Standalone report** (`build_standalone_report`): a brand-new .xlsx with a
  Summary sheet and a Findings sheet, written with openpyxl. It contains no
  part of the analyzed workbook, so it is always a valid file regardless of
  what the source contains.
* **Workbook copy + report sheets** (`build_report_workbook`): the analyzed
  workbook (already an immutable copy -- see app/inventory.py) with
  `Mind_Readiness_Report` and `..._Summary` sheets appended. This is written
  by **Excel itself through COM** whenever Excel is available, because a
  pure-Python (openpyxl) save drops package parts it doesn't model -- Power
  Pivot data models, customXml, slicers, controls -- and the result then
  doesn't open in Excel at all (verified on a real 13 MB Mind workbook). The
  openpyxl path remains only as a fallback for machines without Excel and is
  labelled as reduced fidelity in the returned result.

Both are verified by re-opening the output in Excel when Excel is available
(`ReportBuildResult.verified_opens_in_excel`) -- that check is what "a real
working Excel file" means in this app.

JSON stays available for scripting via scripts/validate_workbook.py.
