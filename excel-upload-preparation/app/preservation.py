"""Package-part comparison: a pure before/after diff of two OOXML zip
packages. Used by scripts/compare_packages.py. This is inspection only (no
mutation), so it's safe to implement in the MVP even though full change-set
application (phase 8) isn't built yet.

Per instructions/preservation.md, differences should be classified as
AUTHORIZED_CHANGE / EXPECTED_RECALCULATION_CHANGE / METADATA_CHANGE /
UNAUTHORIZED_CHANGE / UNVERIFIABLE_CHANGE. This MVP has no change-set
context to know what was *authorized*, so every changed/added/removed part
is reported as UNVERIFIABLE_CHANGE -- an honest default, not a guess.
