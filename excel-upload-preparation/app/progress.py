"""Scan progress (1.6.6): the stages a scan goes through, their weights and
the overall figure -- shared by the web server's status endpoint
(GET /api/sessions/{id}/status) and the Streamlit status bar.

The engine reports `progress(stage, message, fraction, **facts)` from
app/inventory.py (copy, load, inventory, names) and app/modes/common.py
(rules, report); the callers add convert (an .xlsb goes through Excel
first) and plan. Weights were measured on real models: reading the
workbook dominates, then the cell pass, then the rules.
