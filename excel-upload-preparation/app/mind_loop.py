"""The app runs itself against real Milliman Mind (1.6.8).

One call -- ``run_loop(LoopConfig(...))`` -- takes a raw model workbook and,
with nobody watching, repeats:

    prepare a fresh copy  ->  local gates  ->  upload to Mind  ->  convert
    ->  add template  ->  run  ->  read what Mind shows  ->  decide

until everything looks good and the numbers match, or until it can say
precisely why it cannot get there. Every decision is a rule in this file;
no model, no person and no assistant is consulted while it runs (the
assistant is used exactly once, before the first iteration, to name grids
-- and only if it is reachable).

"Everything looks good" means, per iteration:
  prepared        the prep plan applied through Excel and the copy opens
  numbers         a full Excel recalculation of the prepared copy matches a
                  full recalculation of the source cell for cell. Cells the
                  plan wrote as *content* (titles, moved labels) are the
                  plan's intent and are not compared; cells whose *formula*
                  the plan rewrote are compared under the conservative rule:
                  the value is unchanged, or an error became another error
                  (never a valid value into anything else); every other
                  cell must be identical, an error may become another error
  structure       the grid count did not balloon (a shattered workbook is
                  the failure mode of a bad row insert)
  names           every grid the plan could title is titled; what is left is
                  the list of grids the app cannot title, with reasons
  convert         Mind's Upload / Convert / Test wizard all Complete
  run             Mind ran the model and reports it consistent with the
                  audit trail
  counts          the number of 'Untitled(r,c)' entries Mind lists equals
                  the number of untitled grids the app predicted

A gate that could not be checked is a failure, never a pass. When a gate
fails the loop changes *one* thing about the next iteration -- enable an
opt-in fix Mind's error log asks for, disable the action whose edits moved
a number (found by walking the changed cell's precedents back to the cell
an action wrote) -- and starts again from the ORIGINAL source. It never
re-preps its own output (that grows a workbook for ever fewer names). When
no rule applies it stops and says so: that report is the developer's cue.

Guardrails: the source is never modified (immutable copies everywhere);
only sandbox projects (``zzz_`` prefix, ``MindReady_Sandbox`` folder) are
created or deleted; a project that has been run cannot be deleted by
automation and is listed for manual cleanup.
