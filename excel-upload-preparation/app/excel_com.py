"""Shared Excel COM session helper (Windows + pywin32 + an installed Excel).

Why every *output* workbook goes through Excel rather than openpyxl
(CHANGELOG 1.3.0): openpyxl round-trips only the parts it understands. Real
Mind workbooks carry parts it doesn't -- a Power Pivot data model
(`xl/model/item.data`, 13 MB in the test workbook), `customXml/` items,
slicers, form controls... -- and it drops them silently. The resulting file
then fails to open in Excel at all ("Open method of Workbooks class
failed"), confirmed on this machine against a real workbook. Excel itself
is the only writer that preserves everything, so it is used whenever it is
available; the openpyxl path is kept only as an explicitly-labelled
reduced-fidelity fallback.

Every session: hidden, alerts off, macros force-disabled
(`AutomationSecurity = 3`), links never updated, events off.
