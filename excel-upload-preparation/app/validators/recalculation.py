"""READY-001. A real recalculation adapter exists (app/recalc.py, Excel COM
automation), but per modes/plan-mode.md ("Recalculation is optional...") and
instructions/workflow.md (recalculation is a VERIFY-step action, not part of
plain ANALYZE/VALIDATE), it is NOT run automatically as part of every rule
pass -- that would launch Excel and take minutes on every analysis. It's a
deliberate, separate action: scripts/recalculate_workbook.py, or the UI's
Recalculate button. This finding reports NOT_SUPPORTED because recalculation
was not run *as part of this pass* -- not because no adapter exists."""
