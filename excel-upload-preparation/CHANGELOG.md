### Grid Namer: the user draws the grid names, the conventions do the rest

A new **Grid Namer** screen (sidebar), for the person who knows what a block
of cells *means*: the whole current version of the workbook is shown sheet by
sheet (calculated values where the file carries them, else the formula text;
detected grids outlined and colour-coded — title cells, named grids, untitled
grids, areas queued for naming). Drag over an area, give it a name, tick the
documented flags (`/Input`, `/Export`, …, from `references/mind-flags.yaml`;
flags with arguments typed as text), and **Submit** writes the
`#Name /Flags` titles into a new Excel-verified version. Everything the user
did not touch is titled in the same apply by the existing conventions
(captions, labels, headers, assistant names) — optional, on by default.

- **Naming labels Mind's detection, it does not redraw it**: each selection is
  resolved to the one detected grid it touches. A selection across several
  grids is refused with their refs ("Mind reads them separately"); the one
  exception is the documented caption-above-a-table pair, which is exactly
  what a user selects as "one table" — the caption becomes the title and the
  pair becomes one named grid.
- **Same reference-safety rules as the automatic titler** (`plan_named_areas`
  in `app/prep.py`): a title cell, above-cell or row insert that some formula
  reads is refused with the reader named; a refused area is also excluded from
  the automatic pass (retrying would only repeat the refusal). Renaming a
  titled grid releases its old name; user names are reserved so the automatic
  pass uniquifies against them (`plan_create_grid_titles` grew
  `exclude` / `reserved` / `pre_titled` / `pre_inserted` for this — one
  combined apply, no collisions, shared row inserts).
- **Endpoints**: `GET /api/sessions/{id}/sheet-cells` (one sheet's used area,
  value-or-formula per cell, from the last recalculation when there is one),
  `GET /api/mind-flags` (documented title flags with their meaning),
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/grid-namer` (plan manual + automatic titles, apply
  via Excel, new version `source: "grid_namer"`, re-analysis, refusals with
  reasons in `skipped`).
- **Browser tab** now reads `MindPrep v<version>` from the running backend
  (`document.title` after `/api/health`; static fallback "MindPrep" in the
  built page).
- **One half of an untitled caption pair is extended to the pair** (found by
  the live smoke test on the caption layout): naming only the table half
  would leave the caption column to the automatic pass, whose separate title
  lands adjacent and makes the re-detected grids merge wrongly. The UI's
  selection panel mirrors the extension ("+ its table, named as one grid").
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_grid_namer.py` — 11 new (resolution, caption pair,
  pair extension from one half, canonical flag casing, unknown-flag refusal,
  read-title refusal, old-name release, reserved-name uniquifying, shared row
  inserts, and the three endpoints end-to-end through the FastAPI
  TestClient). 135 total.

## 1.6.8

### The app runs itself against real Milliman Mind

`app/mind_loop.py` (new) + `scripts/run_in_mind.py` + `POST/GET
/api/sessions/{id}/mind-loop` + the **Mind** screen. One call takes a raw model
and, unattended, repeats *prepare a fresh copy → local gates → upload →
convert → add template → run → read what Mind shows → decide* until every gate
passes or it can say exactly why not. No person and no assistant is consulted
while it runs (the assistant names grids once, before the first iteration, when
reachable). Runbook: `docs/RUN_IN_MIND_LOOP.md` (CLI, app, reading the report,
every `stuck` reason, the numbers gate, cleanup); short form in
`docs/RUN_IN_MIND.md`, Part D.

- **Gates** (all must pass; a gate that cannot be checked is a failure, never a
  pass): prepared · numbers · structure · names · convert · run (Mind: *consistent
  with the audit trail*) · counts (Mind's `Untitled(r,c)` count == the app's
  predicted untitled count).
- **Numbers gate** (`numbers_gate` / `compare_values`): fresh copies of source and
  prepared workbook are fully recalculated by Excel and compared cell for cell,
  mapping coordinates back through the plan's row inserts (`row_map`, keyed by the
  plan's source sheet names so `&&Hide` renames still resolve). Cells the plan
  wrote as content (titles, moved labels) are skipped; cells whose *formula* the
  plan rewrote (`fix_broken_refs`) are compared under the conservative rule --
  unchanged, or error → error, never a valid value into anything else. Volatile
  cells (`NOW()`, `TODAY()`, `RAND*`) and their transitive dependents are skipped;
  chart sheets are ignored.
- **One change per retry, always from the original source**: enable the opt-in
  fix Mind's Convert log asks for (`MIND_ERROR_TO_ACTION`); disable the action to
  blame for a moved number (`actions_touching` walks the changed cell's
  precedents -- references and defined names -- back to a cell an action wrote,
  so a formula rewrite outranks a row insert on the same sheet); disable the
  insert-heaviest action when the grid count balloons. Default-on actions are
  as disableable as opt-ins (`active_actions`). No rule → `stuck` with the reason.
- **Mind operations** folded into `app/mind_client.py` from the proven scratch
  flows: `open_manager`, `ensure_folder`, `create_blank_project`, `open_project`,
  `upload_and_convert` (wizard statuses + error log), `add_template`, `run_model`,
  `template_names` / `untitled_entries` (the `<stem> ▾` selector, decoded to
  cells), `export_summary`, `delete_project` (sandbox names only; the tile's own
  menu via DOM ancestry, and the confirmation modal must name the exact project
  or the delete is refused). `.xlsb` sources are converted through Excel first.
- **A title may never change a value** (`prep.reference_index`, `referenced_by`,
  `whole_reference_to`). The first unattended run's numbers gate caught the
  titling action changing **790 cells** of the real Shlomo model: a title written
  into column A of the policy table was counted by `=COUNTA(CoverageDetails!A:A)`
  and the model picked a *different policy*; titles inside `Parameters!C36:C119`
  were returned by `INDEX` lookups; the company name in `Information!A1` was
  "moved" into a title while five sheets read `=Information!A1`. Every write
  site of `create_grid_titles` / `separate_merged_grids` now asks what the
  workbook's formulas and defined names read: no title into a cell any formula
  reads, no row insert on a sheet a formula counts or indexes over whole columns,
  no caption rewritten when something reads it, and a label that is read stays
  in place (its text still names the grid). Each refusal is listed with the
  reading formula. On Shlomo: 109 safe titles remain, 41 refused.
  **Last night's converted model carried this corruption unnoticed -- Mind's
  "consistent with the audit trail" only checks Mind against the workbook's own
  cached values.**
- **Counts gate is reported, not enforced**: Mind's `Untitled(r,c)` entries are
  matched cell by cell against the app's untitled anchors (`untitled_counts`);
  Mind reads some blocks differently from the app (on Shlomo, 17 grids Mind
  starts one column later than the app does, e.g. `D13` vs `C13`). That is a
  detection gap no prep action can change, so it is written to
  `detection_gaps` in the report instead of blocking convergence.
- Adversarial review before the first unattended run found and fixed 11
  defects, four of which would have produced a false *converged*: rewritten
  cells never compared, a numbers gate that could not run counted as passed, a
  Mind failure after Convert falling through, default-on actions never
  disableable. Regression tests in `tests/unit/test_mind_loop_review.py`.

**Reference run (2026-08-30, raw Shlomo model, unattended):** run 1 stopped
itself twice -- numbers gate (790 changed cells, titling disabled), then the
counts mismatch -- and led to the two changes above; run 2 **converged in one
iteration**: 136 operations applied, 63,174 cells compared / 0 differ, grids
181 → 155, untitled 181 → 75 (55 refused with the reading formula named),
Upload/Convert/Test complete, model run consistent with the audit trail, Mind
listing 51 `Untitled` (8 Mind-only, 32 app-only detection gaps). Output and
report under `runs/shlomo_20260830_converged/`.

124 unit tests (the offline loop test preps through Excel, recalculates both
copies and converges on the local gates alone).

## 1.6.7

### Grid naming: error values are not titles, headings become names, and the assistant can name the rest

Driven by a grid-by-grid audit of the real Shlomo model in Milliman Mind, where
the template list showed `Untitled(60,8)` blocks beside meaningless names like
`Cashflows C4` and `I`.

- **`#N/A` is no longer read as a grid title** (`grids.looks_like_title`, new
  `ERROR_LITERALS`). Excel stores error *values* as text starting with '#', so
  five `#N/A` cells inside `CoverageDetails!A6:CF416` (a 411x84 policy data
  table) were reported as titles "trapped" in the grid (STR-001) -- and the
  default-on `separate_merged_grids` action offered to insert whole rows
  straight through that table to free them. Applying the old plan shattered the
  workbook from 156 grids to 258 in one pass (and to 648 over three). With the
  fix the same plan moves it 156 -> 160. **This was a data-structure-destroying
  default; anyone who ran prep on a model containing error values should
  re-check the result.**
- **Section headings above a block are now used as its name**
  (`prep._section_header_name`). Real models write a section number beside a
  section title on the row directly above the block it heads, so the cell above
  is neither blank nor a loose label and every earlier heuristic missed it. The
  Shlomo model now names blocks "Demographic Assumptions", "Expense Cashflow
  Calculation", "All Cashflows - Direct" ... instead of "Cashflows C4".
- **A grid whose cell above is occupied is no longer skipped**: the title
  action inserts a row (only when no other grid spans it) and writes the title
  there, the way it already did for a grid starting on row 1. Unnamed grids in
  the Shlomo model drop 60 -> 39 in a single pass with no fragmentation.
  Post-insert coordinates are resolved centrally in `prep._ordered`
  (`_resolve_insert_at`), so a title still lands correctly when other actions
  in the same approved set insert rows above it.
- **Context-aware names from the APIM assistant** (`app/grid_naming.py`, new):
  `build_grid_context` collects the cells above, left and inside a grid (with
  formulas shown as `formula => computed value`), and `suggest_names` asks for
  short names in one batched call per 25 grids. `POST /api/sessions/{id}/grid-names`
  returns deterministic-vs-suggested for review and folds the accepted names
  into the prep plan. Names are advisory and never bypass review: they only
  change *which* name `create_grid_titles` proposes, never where it writes or
  whether the edit is safe, and they are used only where the deterministic name
  is weak (`prep.is_weak_name`). With the gateway unavailable the deterministic
  name stands.

- **Runbook + CLI**: `docs/RUN_IN_MIND_NAMING.md` records how to reproduce this
  audit by hand, and `scripts/audit_grid_names.py` is the whole read-only audit in
  one command (`--context` dumps the cells around each unnamed grid, `--suggest`
  adds the assistant's names).

Rule set unchanged: 105 rules, 96 active. 98 unit tests.

## 1.6.6

### Broken-#REF! handling, FILTER supported, value reconciliation (from the real-Mind Shlomo loop)

Found by an autonomous loop that uploaded a real model (Shlomo_IFRS) to live
Milliman Mind, read what failed, and fixed the app until Mind converts it.

- **REF-001** (`validators.structure.broken_defined_name_refs`): flags cells that
  reference a broken (#REF!) defined name OR contain a literal #REF! -- Mind's
  converter cannot compile these ("not a function" / "Formula compilation error").
  A new **opt-in** prep action ("Replace broken (#REF!) references with NA()")
  rewrites every standalone broken reference to `NA()`: an error stays an error, so
  no valid result changes (IFERROR fallbacks and live branches keep their value);
  array formulas are handled; a range-endpoint #REF! is left for review.
- **FILTER is Mind-supported** (`validators.formula.MIND_CONFIRMED_SUPPORTED`): the
  KB "Supported Excel formulas" scrape omits FILTER but real Mind conversion accepts
  it, so FRM-002 no longer flags it. Extensible as more functions are confirmed.
- **REP-001** (`validators.structure.totals_reconcile`): value reconciliation --
  flags any total (`=SUM(range)` or `=a+b+c`) whose value does not equal the sum of
  its addends. Report-only (never changes numbers).

Rule set: 105 rules, 96 active (REF-001 + REP-001 added). 87 unit tests. Confirmed
end-to-end: the app's fixes make the raw Shlomo model convert cleanly in real Mind.

## 1.6.5

### Aligned with Mind's converter: reject /ProjectSettings setting names Mind doesn't recognise

Driven by the real-Mind closed loop: uploading a workbook to Milliman Mind and
reading its verdict showed that declaring an `EnableCheckFormatInputManager` or
`EnableDebugMode` setting in a `/ProjectSettings` grid makes Mind's **Convert**
step fail ("The <name> setting does not exist") -- yet the app was *recommending*
the former (INP-006) and *crediting* the latter (PRJ-005). A minimal workbook
without them converts cleanly.

- **New rule PRJ-006** (`validators.project.prj_006`): flags any `/ProjectSettings`
  setting name Mind's converter rejects (`MIND_INVALID_SETTINGS`, seeded with the
  two confirmed names) as ERROR -- "uploading this workbook fails the Convert step".
- **INP-006** no longer tells users to add an `EnableCheckFormatInputManager`
  setting; it explains that format checking is toggled per grid in Mind's Input
  Manager at import time (not a workbook setting) and points to PRJ-006.
- **PRJ-005** no longer credits a Mind-invalid name as a configured debug setting.
- Fixtures: the well-formed fixture drops the two invalid settings; the broken
  fixture declares one so PRJ-006 is exercised.

Rule set: 103 rules, **94 active** (PRJ-006 added; FORMULA-001 was removed in 1.6.4).
Also confirmed against real Mind: the upload accepts **XLSX/XLSM only** (not .xlsb).

## 1.6.4

### Hidden readiness sheets, a workbook view for every error, FORMULA-001 gone, Download in the sidebar

- **Readiness sheets are hidden.** `Mind_Readiness_Report` and
  `..._Summary` in the "with report" copy are written as hidden sheets (both
  the Excel and the openpyxl writer; a visible sheet stays active), so the
  copy can be uploaded to Mind without the report being read as data.
- **What is going on in the workbook.** Every Fix panel (finding sites,
  recalculation errors, root-cause groups) shows an *In the workbook* grid
  around the cell -- the cells' contents as Excel last stored them, with
  the error cell highlighted -- and a **Show formulas** toggle that swaps
  in the formulas (`{...}` marks an array formula; members show the
  anchor's formula). Click a cell in the list to move the view. Backend:
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/cells?sheet=&cell=&rows=&cols=`
  (`inventory.cell_window`); values come from the last recalculation of the
  current version when there is one, else from the analysis copy.
- **FORMULA-001 removed** ("a target version is configured but no
  per-version compatibility matrix is implemented"): it could never be
  anything but NOT_SUPPORTED and only ever blocked the overall status.
  Rule set: 102 rules, 93 active (function support is still checked by
  FRM-002 against the KB list).
- **Download area** in the sidebar: the latest version (label, verified
  mark, file name) with a one-click download; a compact icon when the
  sidebar is collapsed.

Tests: 84 (was 83): the cells endpoint (contents, formulas, array members
after a recalculation) and hidden-sheet assertions on both report writers.

## 1.6.3

### Every error can be fixed; errors with one root cause are fixed together

- Recalculation errors are **grouped by root cause** (`app/recalc.py::
  group_errors`): `#NAME?` from the same unknown function(s); any error from
  formulas of the same *shape* (`formula_signature`: references -> REF,
  numbers -> N, strings masked); add-in-gap `#NAME?` by the MM_ function(s)
  involved. The recalculation result carries `groups` (biggest first).
- Recalculate screen: a "Shared root causes -- fix all at once" section
  with one **Fix all N** button per group; every formula-error row has a
  **Fix** button plus a "shared xN" badge that opens the group; every
  add-in-gap line has **Ask / Fix**. Nothing is left without a fix option.
- Fix panel: a **group mode** (all cells listed, "Propose one fix for all N
  cells", quick fixes = planned changes touching any of the cells, apply,
  then "Recalculate now" reporting how many of the N still fail); the
  single-error mode shows "Same root cause in K other cells -- Fix all N"
  and switches to the group; a **Propose a fix** button is always present
  (findings with several sites ask for one fix covering all sites; add-in
  gaps ask the assistant to confirm none is needed).
- Assistant: a group focus tells the model the cells share one cause and
  asks for operations that fix EVERY listed cell (one per cell, or a range
  when the same formula applies) and to say so; a single-error focus lists
  its siblings so the answer says they can all be fixed together; the
  `<recalculation>` context now starts with the root causes.

- **Array formulas are changed as a unit.** Excel refuses to change part of
  a Ctrl+Shift+Enter array, and the old executor silently rewrote the *whole*
  array whenever any of its cells got `set_formula`. Now: recalculation
  errors carry `array` (e.g. `C7:C9`) and the group cause names it; when the
  operations cover every cell of the array it is dismantled first and each
  cell gets exactly the proposed content; a fix that covers only part of it
  fails with a clear message (nothing half-applied) unless it addresses the
  top-left cell alone, which replaces the whole array formula and is
  recorded as such; a new assistant operation `set_array_formula`
  `{sheet, range, formula}` writes one array over a range. The assistant is
  told which cells form an array (including the members that are not in
  error) and to fix the whole of it; `validate_proposal` refuses any
  operation that covers only part of a known array, naming the uncovered
  cells, and a rejected proposal is sent back to the model once with the
  validation errors so it can repair it (`proposal_retries`). Validation
  also refuses **no-op operations** (a value/formula the cell already has,
  the same array formula re-entered, clearing an empty cell) so a "fix"
  that changes nothing is bounced back to the model instead of being
  applied and reported as a change. For an array formula the model also gets
  the decisive fact -- the array's size versus the ranges it references --
  with the concrete fix when it overflows its source (`array_size_hint`:
  "set_array_formula on C5:C6 with the same formula and clear_cell C7:C9"),
  both in the focus prefix and in the rejection; up to two repair rounds.
- Fix panel and assistant note now report **failed operations** ("1 change
  could not be applied: Arr!C9 — …") instead of only counting successes;
  COM errors show Excel's own message.

Tests: 83 (was 76): grouping (signature normalisation, unknown-function,
add-in and shape groups, ordering), the group / sibling / array chat focus,
partial-array proposal refusal, the proposal retry, and the Excel-backed
array-unit executor test.

## 1.6.2

### Ask / Fix on recalculation errors

- Recalculate screen: every genuine formula error row has an **Ask / Fix**
  button (the error value itself is clickable too) and every add-in-gap
  `#NAME?` line has **Ask**; both open the same Fix panel used by Findings,
  now with a *recalculation* mode: the error and the formula Excel
  evaluated, what the error means, quick fixes = planned changes that
  target that exact cell, and the mini chat focused on the error
  ("Explain this error", "Propose a fix", "Which cells does this formula
  depend on?"). After applying a change the panel offers **Recalculate
  now** and reports whether the cell still fails; the Recalculate screen
  keeps the latest result (store-backed) and flags it as stale when the
  workbook version moved on.
- Backend: the session remembers the last recalculation
  (`recalc.version_id` tells which version it ran on); `POST .../chat`
  accepts a recalc `focus {kind: "recalc", sheet, cell, error, formula,
  addin_gap}` and always appends the last recalculation (status, genuine
  error cells with formulas, add-in-gap cells) to the assistant's context
  (`app/chat_context.py::recalculation_context`). The system prompt tells
  the assistant to fix genuine errors from the cell's formula and never to
  "fix" an add-in-gap `#NAME?` by rewriting an MM_ formula.
- **Fixed**: a recalculation run after an Excel apply in the same process
  failed with "The interface is unknown" (RPC_S_UNKNOWN_IF) -- the exact
  sequence the Fix panel performs (apply, then "Recalculate now").
  `app/recalc.py` had its own COM lifecycle that released Range/Worksheet
  proxies *after* `CoUninitialize`, poisoning the apartment for the next
  session. It is now built on `app/excel_com.py::excel_session` with every
  proxy scoped inside an inner function (`_scan`), like every other Excel
  path in the app; the stray "Windows fatal exception 0x80010108" noise is
  gone too.
- Recalculation results carry `ran`: false when Excel could not run at all
  (COM failure / pywin32 missing), so an errored run is never mistaken for
  "no errors" -- the Recalculate screen shows it as a failure and the Fix
  panel's "Recalculate now" reports "could not run" instead of "fixed".

Tests: 76 (was 73): recalc-focused chat gets the error prefix, the cell
contents and the `<recalculation>` context; the recalculate endpoint
records the version; regression for recalculate -> Excel apply ->
recalculate in one process (skipped without Excel).

## 1.6.1

### Fixed: a fix did not show up after re-analysis (web app)

The engine was right (re-analysing v2 after an apply dropped the fixed
rules); the web front-end lost the information on the way:
- the Prep apply did not re-analyse, so Findings kept showing the previous
  version until a manual re-analysis;
- a rule that became PASS simply *disappeared* from the table (PASS is
  filtered out by default), so a fixed blocker looked "not fixed";
- a partially fixed rule (e.g. FRM-002 with several call sites) stayed ERROR
  with no sign of progress.

Now every apply (Prep, Assistant, Fix panel) re-analyses the new version
in the same request, and the backend returns a **delta** against the
previous analysis (`fixed` / `improved` / `regressed` rule ids and the
status counts side by side). The Findings screen shows a "Since the
previous analysis" banner, keeps fixed rules visible with a FIXED badge
("show fixed rows"), and the Prep result card says what changed.
Re-analyse always targets the current (latest) version and refreshes the
version list. `correction_available` on each finding now means "the
current prep plan has an operation for it" (it used to reflect a YAML flag
that is true for only three rules). FRM-002 reports up to 25 call sites
per function instead of one.

### Fix panel -- click a finding, fix it there

- Clicking a status pill or the **Fix / Ask** button on any non-PASS row
  of the Findings table, or a grid card in the **Workbook Map**, opens a
  side panel for that finding: rule, status, location, message, every
  `Sheet!Cell` site from the finding's observed data, **quick fixes** (the
  prep-plan actions that cover the rule, applied with one click) and a
  **mini chat** focused on the finding ("Explain this finding", "Propose a
  fix", or free text). Proposals from the mini chat are applied right
  there; after any apply the panel re-reads the new analysis and shows
  "<rule> is now PASS" (FIXED badge) or the remaining status.
- Backend: `POST .../chat` accepts `focus {rule_id, sheet, cell}`, which is
  prefixed to the question so the retrieval pulls that finding's observed
  data and the cell contents into the turn.
- Workbook Map cards now show only the findings located *inside* that grid
  (or on its title cell) -- previously every card on a sheet showed the
  sheet's worst finding -- plus their rule ids; sheet-level findings appear
  as chips above the cards.
- Workbook screen: "Load another workbook" starts a new session.

Verified in a real browser: Fix on PAR-002 -> quick fix -> panel says
"PAR-002 is now PASS" with FIXED badge, banner "fixed 2 -- PAR-002,
PRJ-002", fixed row visible; grid card click opens the panel; mini chat on
TRN-001 explains the finding via the live gateway, proposes the header fix
and applies it -> "TRN-001 is now PASS".

Tests: 73 (was 71): delta + fixability after apply/re-analyse (incl.
honest regression when going back to v1) and finding-focused chat.

## 1.6.0

The Figma-built "Mind Ready" front-end (`Mind Copilot Skill/FigmaOutput`,
React 19 + Vite + Tailwind, generated from docs/FIGMA_UI_PROMPT.md) is now
wired to the engine through a FastAPI backend. The Streamlit UI is unchanged
and still works.

### Backend -- `app/web/server.py`

- One endpoint per function of the front-end's `src/services/api.ts`:
  `POST /api/sessions` (upload + mode, `.xlsb` converted through Excel
  first), `POST /api/sessions/{id}/reanalyze`, `.../apply` (operations ->
  new verified version, optional re-analysis in the same call),
  `.../suggest`, `.../chat`, `.../recalculate`, `.../reports`,
  `GET .../versions`, `GET .../files/{name}`, `GET /api/health`.
- Per-session **version lineage**: v1 original upload (v2 converted for
  `.xlsb`), then one version per apply -- prep, assistant or formula fix --
  each a separate file written by Excel, verified to open, with its change
  log; download names are unique within the session.
- The engine's dicts are mapped onto the TypeScript contracts
  (`WorkbookSummary` built from the inventory: sheets, grids with titles/
  flags/headers/inner titles, standalone text, protection; `ValidationReport`
  and `PrepAction` pass through; `ApplyResult`, `ChatReply` with validated
  proposals, `RecalcResult`, `ReportBuild`, `Version`).
- Serves the built front-end (`FigmaOutput/dist`, or `MIND_READY_DIST`)
  with an SPA fallback, so `run_mind_ready_web.bat` -> http://localhost:8600
  is the whole app. `requirements.txt`: fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart.

### Front-end wiring (`FigmaOutput/src`)

- `services/api.ts` talks to `/api` (mocks remain behind
  `VITE_USE_MOCKS=true`); `vite.config.ts` proxies `/api` to :8600 in dev.
- Fixes to what only worked with mocks: the upload screen now selects a real
  file and runs on "Run analysis" (it used to post an empty fake file);
  download links use the real session id; "Re-analyze" (top bar and prep
  result card) refreshes summary, report and plan; the prep selection resets
  when a new plan arrives; applying an assistant proposal updates the store
  from the backend's re-analysis and offers the changed file; errors surface
  inline instead of failing silently.

Verified in a real browser against the running server: upload -> findings
(table + workbook map) -> prep apply (Excel, verified) -> download ->
re-analyze -> history lineage -> assistant change via the live gateway
(rename sheet) -> re-analyzed -> reports generated and downloaded.

Tests: 71 (was 65) -- `tests/unit/test_web_api.py` covers health, upload
contracts, mode filtering and input validation, apply + version lineage +
download + re-apply, chat with a validated proposal, reports and
recalculation.

## 1.5.1

- **Fixed**: applying changes a second time (to the file the previous apply
  produced) crashed with `shutil.copy2` -> `CopyFile2` -- the copy helper
  targeted `work_dir/<name>`, which *was* the source. `make_immutable_copy`
  now never copies a file onto itself or over a previous output: when the
  target exists it uses a versioned sub-folder (`v2/`, `v3/`, ...). Every
  earlier output stays intact. Regression test added.
- UI restyled, behaviour unchanged: the upload / mode / run workflow moved
  to a sidebar with a "current file" card (name, status pill, sheet/grid/
  formula counts) and environment notes; status pills and KPI tiles replace
  emoji; sections are a segmented control (still session-keyed, so a long
  Excel apply no longer hides its own result); prep actions, apply results,
  proposals and report downloads sit in bordered cards; the findings table
  has fixed column widths.

## 1.5.0

The assistant can now change the workbook on request, and the grid-title
prep action names grids from their surroundings.

### Ask the assistant -- "tell it to change anything"

- `app/chat_context.py`: the system prompt defines a change protocol. The
  assistant can (a) request cell contents / grid rows / sheet listings /
  function call sites it hasn't seen with a ```lookup block -- the app
  answers within the same turn (up to 2 lookups) -- and (b) end its answer
  with a ```changes block: `set_value`, `set_formula` (single cells or
  ranges; relative references adjust like fill-down), `clear_cell`,
  `rename_sheet`, `insert_row`, `insert_column`, `set_sheet_visibility`,
  `unprotect_sheet`.
- `app/prep.py::validate_proposal` checks every proposed operation against
  the real workbook (sheet exists -- case-insensitive match --, cell/range
  parses, formulas start with '=', sheet names legal and unique, row/column
  valid) and looks up the current cell value for the before/after table;
  malformed operations are reported, never applied.
- UI: the proposal appears under the conversation as a before/after table
  with **Apply** / **Discard**. Apply writes it through Excel to a fresh
  copy, verifies the file opens, **re-analyzes it automatically** (so the
  next question is answered against the changed workbook), notes the
  outcome in the conversation and offers the changed file for download.
  The model's text is never written into the workbook by itself.
- Conversation notes (analysis / apply outcomes) are now part of the
  history the model sees.

### Prep workbook -- context-aware grid titles

- `create_grid_titles` (replaces `title_untitled_grids`, now on by default)
  gives every untitled grid exactly one `#Name` title:
  - **caption above a table**: a text cell whose right neighbour is empty
    while the row below starts a wider block -- Mind (and the app's
    detection) read the caption as a one-column grid that swallows the
    table's first column and the rest of the table as a second grid ("two
    headers for one range"); the caption gets a `#` prefix and the table
    becomes one grid;
  - **empty cell above**: the name comes from a standalone label above
    (blank row between) or to the left -- the label is *moved* into the
    title (cleared afterwards), so no orphan text remains -- else from the
    text header row, else sheet + position;
  - **grid on row 1**: a row is inserted first (only when that cuts no
    other grid), then the title is written at the post-insert coordinate.
  - Names are made unique across the workbook; a grid that already has a
    title, or contains a trapped title (STR-001), is never given another;
    a standalone label that is not next to any grid is reported in the
    action's skip notes rather than touched.
- Executor: new `clear_cell`, `insert_column`, `set_sheet_visibility`
  operations; range targets for value/formula ops; operations flagged
  `after_inserts` run after the row/column inserts (post-insert
  coordinates); openpyxl fallback handles cell ops on ranges and refuses
  the structural ones.

Tests: 64 (was 59): context titles on a fixture with every pattern
(label above, caption, label left, header-row name, row-1 grid) plus an
Excel-backed apply that re-analyzes to all grids titled and STR-004 PASS;
proposal validation (good and bad ops); lookup round-trip and proposal
extraction with a mocked gateway; applying an assistant proposal.

## 1.4.0

Two user-facing features on top of 1.3.0's verified outputs: the app now
**applies real preparation changes** to the workbook (on approval) and has a
**grounded, multi-turn assistant** for questions about the workbook.

### Prep workbook -- actual changes, reviewed cell by cell

- `app/prep.py` (new): `plan_actions()` turns findings into concrete
  *operations* (op, sheet, cell/row, before, after, note) without touching
  any file; `apply_operations()` copies the source (hash first), applies the
  approved operations in **one Excel COM session**, saves, re-opens the
  result in Excel to verify it loads, and appends the change-log sidecar.
  openpyxl remains a fallback for value/formula operations only -- it
  refuses structural ones (renames, row inserts, colours, protection)
  because it cannot keep references/styles intact.
- Actions (rule -> change; default-on unless noted):
  - STR-007: hidden sheets renamed with the `&&Hide` marker (Excel updates
    every formula reference on rename).
  - LOOP-002 + RES-002: loop-name capitalisation normalised in MM_LOOP,
    MM_RESULT, MM_DIMSIZE, MM_DIMINDEX, MM_LOOPLABELS string arguments.
  - INP-005: `/Input` added to `/Reorder` grid titles.
  - FLG-001: undocumented flags that are an unambiguous near-miss of a
    documented one corrected (`/Inpt` -> `/Input`); ambiguous ones skipped
    with a reason.
  - EXP-003 / PRJ-002 / PAR-002 / INP-003: near-miss headers of the special
    grids corrected to the documented column names (`Kind` -> `Type`,
    `Setting` -> `Name`).
  - STR-001: an empty row inserted above a `#Title` trapped inside a grid --
    only when no other grid on the sheet spans that row (otherwise skipped
    with the reason, never a blind insert).
  - FMT-002: theme colours rewritten as explicit RGB (same look).
  - Off by default (they change cell content or security): STR-004 generic
    `#Grid_<sheet>_<anchor>` titles for untitled grids, FMT-003 apostrophe +
    space in styled empty cells (KB recipe), FMT-005 sheet unprotect.
- **Replace an incompatible formula** (FRM-002 / RSK-004 / FORMULA-002):
  pick a flagged cell, optionally ask for an AI suggestion (the suggested
  `=...` line pre-fills the box), edit the replacement yourself, apply. The
  model's text is never written on its own -- only what you approve
  (SKILL.md rule #6 still holds: formulas are never converted to values).
- Every apply offers the prepared file for download and a one-click
  re-analysis of it; the change log records method, verification and every
  applied/failed operation.
- Inventory now keeps the coordinates of theme-coloured and styled-empty
  cells (capped at 5,000 per sheet) so those actions can target exact cells.

### Ask about this workbook -- grounded assistant with memory

- `app/chat_context.py` (new): each turn sends a bounded *context pack*
  (workbook facts, every sheet with its grids/flags/headers, formula and MM_
  statistics, every non-PASS finding in full, the PASS rule ids, and the
  prep actions the app can apply) plus *retrieved detail* for whatever the
  question names -- cell references (formula/value there, enclosing grid),
  sheet and grid names (their rows), rule ids (the finding's observed
  data), MM_ function names (call sites) -- and the conversation so far
  (last 12 turns). The system prompt forbids inventing facts, forbids
  claiming readiness, and routes fixes to "Prep workbook".
- `app/llm.py`: generic `chat_completion()` over the same APIM Claude
  gateway (system as leading message -- the proven payload shape);
  `suggest_formula_fix` now uses it and asks for the replacement formula on
  its own `=` line; `extract_formula()` picks it out for the UI.

### UI

- Sections: Findings / Prep workbook / Ask the assistant / Recalculate /
  Reports, switched with a session-keyed radio rather than `st.tabs` --
  tabs snap back to the first tab after every rerun, which hid the result
  of a long Excel apply (caught by the Playwright check). The old
  per-finding "Apply fix" buttons are superseded by the prep plan
  (FILE-002 conversion still happens automatically for `.xlsb`).
- Verified with Playwright on the broken synthetic model: 7 prep changes
  applied through Excel and verified, prepared file downloaded with the
  corrections in place, assistant answered a grounded question and routed
  the fix to "Prep workbook".

Tests: 59 (was 50) -- prep planning on the well-formed/broken/messy
fixtures, openpyxl apply with re-validation, structural ops refused without
Excel, one Excel-backed apply (rename + unprotect, verified), context pack
and retrieval grounding, chat history threading and gateway payload shape
(mocked).

## 1.3.0

Two things drove this release: hands-on proof that the app hands back a
*working* Excel file, and implementing every rule against the Milliman Mind
knowledge base (`CompleteMindDocn.docx`, a page-by-page scrape of
kb.milliman-mind.com, 431 pages) instead of leaving 65 of 86 active rules
at `NOT_SUPPORTED`.

### Output workbooks are written by Excel, and verified

- **Bug found and fixed**: the 1.2.0 report workbook did not open in Excel
  when built from a real Mind workbook. `openpyxl` silently drops package
  parts it doesn't model -- the test workbook carries a 13 MB Power Pivot
  data model (`xl/model/item.data`) and 20 `customXml` parts -- and Excel
  refused the result ("Open method of Workbooks class failed"), for `.xlsm`
  and `.xlsx` alike. The output had shrunk from 13.7 MB to 0.5 MB.
- `app/excel_com.py` (new): one shared Excel COM session helper (hidden,
  alerts off, macros force-disabled, links never updated) plus
  `verify_opens_in_excel()`, which is now the app's definition of "a real
  working Excel file".
- `app/excel_report.py`: `build_report_workbook` copies the analyzed file and
  lets **Excel itself** append the `Mind_Readiness_Report` /
  `_Summary` sheets (`Range.Value2` bulk write, formatting via COM), then
  re-opens the result in Excel. Returns a `ReportBuildResult` (path,
  method, `verified_opens_in_excel`, warnings). The openpyxl path is kept
  only as a fallback for machines without Excel and is labelled reduced
  fidelity. New `build_standalone_report()` writes a fresh Summary +
  Findings `.xlsx` that is valid regardless of the source workbook.
- `app/change_apply.py`: `fix_loop_case_mismatch` now plans its edits from
  the analysis (`plan_loop_case_fix`) and writes them through Excel
  (`Range.Formula` / `FormulaArray`), verifying the output opens; the change
  log records `method` and `verified_opens_in_excel`. openpyxl fallback as
  above. `convert_output_format` uses the shared session.
- UI: "Generate reports" produces both downloads (standalone report always;
  workbook copy + report only offered when Excel re-opened it) with a
  visible verification line; fixed-workbook downloads show method and
  verification; proper MIME types. Verified end-to-end with Playwright on
  the real 13.7 MB `.xlsm`: uploaded, analyzed, both files downloaded, both
  re-opened by Excel COM, all package parts intact (13,742,301 bytes).
- COM proxies are scoped inside inner functions and collected before
  `Excel.Quit()` (a proxy collected afterwards raises RPC_E_DISCONNECTED in
  the GC, which faulthandler prints as a "Windows fatal exception").

### Every active rule now has a real validator (94 of 94)

- `tools/mine_kb_docx.py` (new, deterministic, zipfile + regex, no
  python-docx): mines the KB scrape into
  `references/mm-function-registry-kb.yaml` (117 MM_ functions, 100 with a
  dedicated article: syntax, category, description), `references/
  supported-excel-functions.yaml` (the KB's "Supported Excel formulas" list,
  217 native functions -- the source the README said was missing) and
  `references/mind-flags.yaml` (49 documented grid/header flags with their
  argument shape and uniqueness, 6 markers; every entry is verified to occur
  in the KB text or the script fails). Scrape artefacts (hyphenated /
  concatenated tokens) are repaired.
- `app/grids.py` (new): Mind's documented grid detection ("General
  structure and guidelines": scan left-to-right/top-to-bottom, extend right
  and down to the first empty cell, ignore alone text cells, text-only first
  row = headers, `#Name /Flag1 /Flag2` title cell above the grid), with
  `/Flag.(arg).x.y` parsing and header markers (`/HideRows`,
  `/InstanceSelect`, `&&HideColumn`, `&hide`).
- `app/formula_utils.py`: string literals and quoted sheet names are masked
  before tokenizing; OOXML storage prefixes are stripped (`_xlfn.`,
  `_xludf.`, `_xlpm.`, and `_xll.` -- Excel stores MMForExcel calls as
  `_xll.MM_LOOP`, seen on the real workbook and previously a false
  FORMULA-002 error); A1-reference parsing (`cell_refs_in_formula`,
  `parse_ref`), literal helpers, call spans.
- `app/inventory.py`: single-pass inventory now also captures array
  formulas (openpyxl returns `ArrayFormula` objects, not `=` strings -- 103
  in the real workbook were invisible to every formula check before),
  data-table formulas, number-format categories vs the KB's preserved list,
  theme colours, styled-empty cells, outlines/hidden rows+columns, data
  validations, conditional formatting, sheet protection, tab colour,
  `docProps/app.xml` Application, VBA part size, package parts only Excel
  can preserve; plus a process-wide cache of the opened workbook
  (`open_cached` / `cell_value`) for validators that read raw cells.
  Real workbook: 3.6 s inventory, 1.3 s for all 94 validators.
- **Fixed**: locked-cell counting (FMT-005) counted every cell, because
  Excel locks cells by default; per the KB, locking only bites on a
  *protected* sheet, so only those are counted now.
- New validator modules: `iteration.py` (CAL-001..005: /CalculationSteps,
  MM_ITERATIONS once per workbook, /iterationinput+/iterationoutput
  pairing), `performance.py` (DBG-001..006: whole-column / >50k-cell
  ranges, lookup review, profiler/debug/F9 recommendations), `io.py`
  (INP-001..006, EXP-001..004: /Input naming, /InputSettings columns and
  `{GridName}`-style patterns, /Reorder prerequisites, format-check
  setting, /Export, unique /ExportSettings with documented columns,
  booleans, extensions and `{yyyyMMdd}`-style tags), `lookup.py`
  (LKP-001..005: MM_READTABLE range starts on a header row, Header names
  exactly one column, duplicate key combinations, ≤6 comparisons,
  not-found text vs NaN), `environment.py` (MMX-001..003: add-in
  requirement and `_xludf.`/`_xll.` prefixes, saving application from
  app.xml, MM_ function classification), `parameter.py` (PAR-001..004:
  Label|Type|PossibleValues|Values, the nine types, `min|max|step` and
  pipe-list syntax), `project.py` (PRJ-001..005: unique /ProjectSettings,
  Name|Value|Locked|Hidden, hidden settings, stochastic configuration incl.
  `#NbSimulations`, debug settings), `kb.py` (see new rules below).
- Extended validators: `structure.py` (STR-001 merged-grid detection via a
  trapped `#Title`, STR-002 alone text cells, STR-003 header recognition
  incl. ERROR on header-matched flagged grids, STR-004 untitled grids,
  STR-005/006 default sheet/workbook names, GRID-004 on real flags),
  `format.py` (FMT-001 number formats outside Standard/Number/Text/Boolean/
  Date, FMT-002 theme colours, FMT-003 styled empty cells, FMT-006
  outlines, FORMAT-001 preservation inventory), `formula.py` (FRM-001
  inventory; **FRM-002 now checks native functions against the KB list**
  and MM_ functions against both registries -- MM_LOOPLABELS is no longer
  a false error; FRM-003 `@` implicit intersection, spill references,
  array formulas; FORMULA-002 VBA UDF detection with a read-only search of
  `vbaProject.bin` for the name), `loop.py` (LOOP-004 MM_LOOPINSTANCE;
  RES-001..005 MM_RESULT: loop names must exist with exact case, no loop
  named twice, omitted dimensions are summed, SIM usage; RZS-001..007:
  MM_SETSIZE `+` syntax / nesting / SetSize-of-SetSize, destination block
  empty or holding the add-in's own copies, resize flags need a driver,
  named groups need two members, fixed ranges that stop on a resizable
  grid's edge, MM_GETRANGE), `risk.py` (RSK-001 two resize drivers in one
  grid, RSK-002 array formulas past the grid boundary).
- `rules/kb-rules.yaml` (new, category `kb`, 8 rules the readiness
  standard doesn't have but the KB states): FLG-001 documented flags with
  argument shape, GRP-001 `/Group.(Name).x.y`, BKP-001 backup
  source/destination pairing + MM_BACKUPBUTTON placement, HID-001
  /HideRows values, RNG-001 MM_RANGE alone in a single-cell table, UNQ-001
  unique special grids, TRN-001 ISO 639-1 translation headers, SIM-001
  `#NbSimulations` content. Rule set 1.2.0: 103 rules, 94 active, 9 draft
  (INS-*/LNK-* multi-workbook, unchanged).
- `app/validators/excel_functions.py`: catalog of native Excel function
  names, used only to tell "native but not Mind-supported" (FRM-002) from
  "not an Excel function at all" (FORMULA-002).
- Report: `FIX_HINTS` for every new rule; `config/default.yaml`
  `large_range_cells: 50000` (DBG-003).
- Tests: 50 unit tests (was 30). `tests/kb_fixtures.py` builds a
  well-formed Mind-style model (every KB-backed validator PASSes, or
  WARNINGs where the KB only asks for review) and a deliberately broken one
  (each validator fails on its own defect), plus array-formula / `@` /
  XLOOKUP / UDF fixtures; pure tests for grid detection and the tokenizer;
  the miner is re-run against the .docx when it is present and must
  reproduce the checked-in files; two Excel-backed tests (skipped without
  Excel) prove the written files open in Excel.

Honesty notes: grid boundaries are this app's implementation of the
documented algorithm, so findings that depend on them carry `INFERENCE`
evidence; the KB's supported-function page is version-agnostic, so
FORMULA-001 (per-version matrix) remains `NOT_SUPPORTED`; READY-001 still
requires an explicit recalculation for PASS; nothing new is auto-applied.

## 1.2.0

UI, Excel-format report output, and real auto-fix/recalculation, in response
to hands-on testing of 1.1.0 against a real workbook. Scope note: the mined
rule set (rules/*.yaml) marks almost nothing `correction.automatic: true` by
its own design (SKILL.md non-negotiable rules #4/#6) -- "auto-fix" here means
genuinely automatic where a rule says it's safe, plus a one-click
human-approved apply for everything else, not blind automatic correction of
arbitrary findings.

- `config/target-version.yaml`: `target_mind_version` defaults to `latest`
  (was `null`). `FORMULA-001` no longer asks `REQUIRES_USER_INPUT` for a
  missing version; it reports `NOT_SUPPORTED` (no compatibility matrix
  exists yet, but a version *is* configured).
- `app/excel_report.py` + `scripts/generate_report_workbook.py`: the primary
  human-facing output is now an Excel workbook (a copy of the analyzed file
  plus an appended `Mind_Readiness_Report` sheet: formatted findings table
  with a deterministic "Recommended Fix" column, plus a summary sheet).
  JSON (`validate_workbook.py`) remains available for scripting.
- `app/recalc.py` (phase 9, real): Excel COM automation (win32com), macros
  force-disabled (`AutomationSecurity`), scans for genuine formula errors
  after `CalculateFullRebuild`. **Important finding from testing on this
  machine**: no MMForExcel add-in is registered, so every `MM_` function call
  shows `#NAME?` when recalculated here -- the adapter detects this (checks
  COMAddIns/AddIns) and reports it as `NOT_SUPPORTED` with an explanation,
  never as a false `ERROR`, separately from genuine formula errors.
  Recalculation is a deliberate, separate action (`scripts/recalculate_workbook.py`,
  the UI's Recalculate button) -- not run automatically during every
  ANALYZE/VALIDATE pass (`modes/plan-mode.md`: "recalculation is optional").
- `app/change_apply.py` (phase 8, narrow real scope): `convert_output_format`
  (Excel COM Save-As, also used to auto-convert an uploaded `.xlsb` before
  analysis -- openpyxl can't read `.xlsb` at all) and
  `fix_loop_case_mismatch` (rewrites a case-inconsistent loop name to its
  most-used spelling across every `MM_`-function string argument that uses
  it). Every apply works on a fresh copy and writes an append-only JSON
  change-log sidecar (`<file>.changelog.json`), never into the workbook.
- `app/llm.py` (phase 7, narrow real scope): one on-demand "suggest a fix"
  call for formula findings (Claude via the shared Milliman APIM gateway,
  same `secret.key`/`config.enc` discovery convention as
  `reserve_narrator/utils/key_loader.py`). Recommendation only, tagged
  `RECOMMENDATION`, never auto-applied.
- `app/ui/streamlit_app.py` + `run_excel_upload_prep.bat`: local web UI --
  upload, run a mode, review findings, apply/suggest fixes per finding,
  recalculate, download the Excel report. Verified end-to-end with a
  real browser (Playwright) against this machine's Streamlit process,
  including a real Claude-via-APIM call and a real Excel COM recalculation.
- `app/validators/formula.py::unsupported_functions` (FRM-002) now locates
  the actual sheet/cell/formula for each unregistered `MM_` call (previously
  only the function name), so the report's Location column and the LLM
  suggestion have real context instead of a bare name.
- `tests/unit/test_excel_report.py`, `tests/unit/test_change_apply.py`: new.
  `app/recalc.py`/`convert_output_format`'s Excel COM paths are not
  unit-tested (require driving real Excel) -- verified manually/via
  Playwright instead.

## 1.1.0

MVP implementation of CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md phases 1-6 (models/schemas, rule
registry, workbook inventory, deterministic validators, mode workflows).
Phases 7-9 (LLM abstraction, change-set application, recalculation adapter)
are **not** built yet -- `READY-001` always reports `NOT_SUPPORTED`, so
`PASS` is unreachable in this version by design, per non-negotiable rule #5.

- Mined `01_Mind_Readiness_Standard.md` (sibling doc, ~90 rules) into
  `rules/*.yaml` via `tools/mine_readiness_standard.py`, and
  `02_MM_Function_Registry.md` (35 MM functions) into
  `references/mm-function-registry.yaml` via `tools/mine_function_registry.py`.
  Both scripts are deterministic parsers, safe to re-run against updated
  source docs.
- **ID collision resolved**: the old hand-authored `loop-rules.yaml`
  (`LOOP-001..003`) overlapped with the doc's own `LOOP-001..004`. The doc's
  IDs are now canonical; the one rule with no doc equivalent (MM_LOOPLABELS
  size matching) was kept, renamed to `LBL-001`.
- **Category strings normalized** so every rule's `category` matches the
  middle segment of its own `validation.implementation` path (`FORMAT-001`
  was `formatting`, `GRID-001`/`GRID-004` were `grid`, `READY-001` was
  `readiness` -- all fixed; a regression test guards this).
- New `app/` package: domain models (`models.py`), rule loader
  (`rules_engine.py`), workbook inventory (`inventory.py`, openpyxl +
  zipfile, never executes VBA/links/OLE), preservation/package-diff
  (`preservation.py`), readiness aggregation (`report.py`,
  `NOT_SUPPORTED > ERROR > REQUIRES_USER_INPUT > WARNING > PASS`), and
  validators/modes packages.
- Implemented validators (everything else in the mined rule set is
  registered but reports its own `on_unevaluable` status, never silently
  skipped): `FILE-001/002`, `STR-001/004/007`, `GRID-001/004`,
  `FMT-004/005/007`, `FRM-002/004`, `FORMULA-001`, `LOOP-001/002/003`,
  `LBL-001`, `RSK-003/004/005`, `READY-001` (always `NOT_SUPPORTED`).
- `INS-*`/`LNK-*` (instance/interlink -- inherently cross-workbook) mined as
  `status: draft`, since `config/default.yaml` has
  `multiple_workbook_context.enabled: false`.
- `scripts/inventory_workbook.py`, `scripts/validate_workbook.py`,
  `scripts/compare_packages.py` are now real (schema-valid JSON output).
  `scripts/apply_changes.py`, `scripts/recalculate_workbook.py`,
  `scripts/verify_recalculation.py` remain honest `NOT_SUPPORTED` stubs
  (phases 8/9, deferred) but now emit schema-correct shapes.
- `tests/unit/`: rule-schema conformance, inventory correctness, validator
  PASS/FAIL behavior on synthetic fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`, built with
  openpyxl at test time, clearly labeled per `tests/README.md`), and a full
  `PLAN_MODE` run validated against `schemas/processing-result.schema.json`.

## 1.0.0

- Initial architecture package.
